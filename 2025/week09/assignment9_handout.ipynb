    "For this question, you will construct a Q matrix for a CTMC model describing transitions between DNA bases, Adenine, Guanine, Cytosine, and Thymine. Remember that nucleotide bases fall into one of two types: purines (A and G) and pyrimidines (C and T). We will model substitutions by assuming two rates exist. One rate, which we will refer to as $r_i$, will describe the instantaneous rate of transitions, i.e., substitution between bases of the same type (i.e., purine -> purine or pyrimidine -> pyrimidine). The other rate, which we will refer to as $r_v$, will capture the rate of transversions, or substitutions across types."

In lecture, we used an example of a CTMC for a two-state (binary) character. For this assignment, we are simulating under a four-state character. For a binary character, we determined if a change by drawing a random number and comparing it to the probability of changing state, based on the off-diagonal element in the row of the _P_ matrix corresponding to the current state. Here, if a change occurs, we could change into one of 3 alternatives. You may find it simplest to use `random.choices()`, which will select a random element from a list using a set of weights (which can be imputed using the `weights` parameter). The weight of moving to a character state is equal to its probability given _P_."
