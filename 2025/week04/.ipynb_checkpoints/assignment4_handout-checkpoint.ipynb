    "**Q1.** Let's say we are interested in understanding the dynamics by which average body length evolves in a trilobite species over its 10 million year stratigraphic record. Suppose we've calculated the mean body length from a population that existed toward the very beginning of the species' existence and want to generate some expectation of what possible paths the species might take if left to evolve entirely stochastically. We can model this problem by setting up a Brownian motion and examining the set of outcomes that occur.\n",

    "Remember from lecture that over a time window, the expected amount of Brownian change is a consequence of both $\\sigma$ and the length of the time window. We measure time in units of million year. We will set the value of $\\sigma$ to be 0.5 (so $\\sigma^2=0.25$ is the variance and $\\sigma=0.5$ is the standard deviation in trait values after 1 million years of evolution). Further, we will collect samples every $dt=0.1$ million years. Instantiate a normal distribution with mean and standard deviation that reflect an unbiased Brownian motion model with rate $\\sigma=0.5$ and $dt=0.1$. We will use this distribution to simulate the amount of evolutionary change between time intervals. Assign it to the variable `norm`. We will use this as the basis to simulate Brownian motion. Next, we will need to simulate. We will store the current body length in the variable `x_t`. Please set the initial value for `x_t` as 100.0 (we will say body length is measured in millimeters). This will represent the population at the beginning of the species' existence that we sampled. Next, construct a loop to simulate Brownian motion from this starting point over the 10 million year range of the species. Please collect samples from this simulation every $dt$ = 0.1 million year (i.e., you should end up with 100 samples over the 10 million year species duration). **[1 pt]**\n",

    "**Q4a.** Let's imagine that we know that, given the environmental conditions reconstructed from the Cambrian rocks in which our trilobite species is found, smaller individuals with a body length of 50 millimeters would possess a mechanical advantage when swimming and hunting prey that we hypothesize may have translated to an increase in fecundity. Let's say that these conditions changed near the beginning of the species' range and differ from the environmental conditions of its ancestral species. We want to understand how the average body length of our trilobite species might change as the population adapts from its starting average body length of 100mm to this new optimum.
